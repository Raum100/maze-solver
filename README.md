# Path Finding

Contains A* algorithm (manhattan heuristic; however, this can easily be changed by creating a euclidean_distance function in the API.py file for example) and Dijkstra's algorithm implementations using a custom text file maze solving API.

# Text Implementations

### Standard maze solve

Run the following command in either the dijkstra or a-star directories:
`python main.py {maze file directory}`

## Unit tests
Run the following command in either the dijkstra or a-star directories:
`python main.py {maze file directory} --unittest {number of unittest iterations}`
